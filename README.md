My 1st project to use python to do data analysis over more than 25 million house transactions to compare the price of houses in different boroughs in London and different regions in UK. 

What are included:
1. Data preprocessing 
2. Data cleaning
3. Data visualization: 
3.1 Compare the average sold house prices between UK and London.
3.2 List the top 10 most expensive regions in UK
3.3 List the top 10 most expensive boroughs in London
3.4 Depict the average price evolution through time from 1995 to 2020 of different regions and districts that I would like to know

Conclusions: 
1. London increases more rapidly then UK in general, especially between 2010 and 2017
2. The COVID does not effect the house pricing market that much in 2020. 
3. The top 5 expensive regions in the UK are: Windsor and Maidenhead, Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole, Greater London, Surrey and Buckinghamshire. 
4. The top 5 expensive boroughs in London are Kensington and Chelsea, City of Westminster, Camden, City of London, Hammersmith and Fulham
